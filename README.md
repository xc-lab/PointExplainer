PointExplainer: Towards Practical Transparent Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis

## Introduction
This work is based on our arXive report, which is going to appear in [Medical Image Anglysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/medical-image-analysis). We proposed an explainable diagnosis framework combined with a digitized hand-drawn test for Parkinson's disease diagnosis.

Deep neural networks have shown potential in analyzing digitized hand-drawn signals for diagnosing Parkinson's disease. However, the lack of interpretability in most existing methods poses a challenge to building user trust. We propose an explainable diagnosis framework, named PointExplainer, for providing personalized predictions suitable for human reasoning. PointExplainer assigns importance values to hand-drawn segments, reflecting their relative contribution to the model's decision. We also verify model behavior consistency to address the issue of faithfulness. 

In this repository, we release code for traning PointExplainer, as well as provide a simple demo showing the personalized reasoning process.
